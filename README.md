# Eurobot 2023 Robotics Project

## Overview
It is with great pride and pleasure that I share my experience as a team member in the **Eurobot 2023** competition. This journey was special both on a technical and personal level, beginning with forming a talented team from the **IEEE INSAT Robotics and Automation Society Chapter**. Starting from scratch, we collaborated to design, develop, and deploy a competitive robot.

## My Contributions

### 1. Obstacle Detection System
- Selected the **YDLidar X2** as the primary sensor for obstacle detection.
- Extracted and processed useful data from the LiDAR to meet the robot's requirements.
- Implemented the **tf package** to manage relationships between coordinate frames effectively.

### 2. Finite State Machine (FSM) Development
- Developed a modular FSM using **ROS** and the **SMACH package** by Jonathan Bohren.
- Achieved seamless synchronization of various robot modules, including navigation, path planning, and obstacle detection.
## Architecture

### 3. Key Achievements
- Learned ROS fundamentals and applied them to build a highly effective obstacle detection module.
- Constructed a robust state machine to ensure smooth operation and synchronization of robot systems.
- Enhanced my technical expertise in **ROS, C++, Python, LiDAR, Raspberry Pi, and Rviz**.

## Competition Highlights
- Represented our team at the international **Eurobot 2023** competition.
- Gained valuable insights by engaging with teams from around the world.
- Proudly received the **Mediation Prize** awarded by **Plan√®te Sciences** for our innovative efforts.
